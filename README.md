# GymTicket
Revolutionizing the way a person visits the gym.

GymTicket is an Android application which aims to replace the traditional way of getting a gym’s membership by a new and innovative way which is helpful for both the customer and the industry.

Traditionally what we do is go to a particular gym and get a membership for it for a particular duration. So, we workout in the same gym for a long duration which
can be boring and repetitive. Also, some machines might not available at a particular gym.

What GymTicket does is it provides a platform for customers, gyms, personal trainers and dietitians to collaborate and do great in their careers.
Once you pay and get a membership for a particular duration, you can go and workout in any gym registered with the app. This helps customers to access best resources in different gyms  and they can workout anywhere they wish without paying extra money to all the gym’s they go to.

Customers can purchase membership in the app, chat with Professionals, view diet plans, read news articles, view gym details and also rate and review the gyms.

Admin can view reports of memberships purchased, user reports and can also manage the users. Payments to gym can also be calculated via the app based on number of visits.

Professionals publish articles and can reply to users on chat.

Gyms can view visitor details, add pictures and read reviews.
